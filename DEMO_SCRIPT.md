# PLUTO — Complete Judge Demo Script (Exact UI Steps)

---

## 30-Second Pitch (say this first)

"PLUTO is a full-stack agentic cybersecurity platform. It monitors live network traffic, scans websites in a sandboxed browser before you load them, and uses Groq's Llama 3.3 70B AI to classify threats in real time. Every AI action — blocking IPs, rate limiting, scanning sites — is governed by Civic's MCP Hub with hard guardrails and a full audit trail. The Chrome extension intercepts your browsing and feeds real traffic into the dashboard. Everything runs in-memory, zero database, zero setup."

---

## Before You Start

1. Open terminal in the project folder
2. Run: `npm run dev`
3. Open Chrome → go to `http://localhost:3000`
4. Keep the terminal visible so judges can see it's a real server

## DEMO STEP 1 — The Dashboard (30 seconds)

**What to show:** The system is already alive and monitoring.

1. The page opens on the **DASHBOARD** tab (default)
2. Point to the **top status bar** — it shows:
   - `SYS:OK` (green dot) — system running
   - `NET:ACTIVE` or `NET:ALERT` — live network status
   - `AI:ONLINE` — Groq LLM connected
   - `TRAFFIC:XX` — live packet count going up
   - `BLOCKED:XX` — blocked IPs count
   - Top-right: `CIVIC:CONNECTED` or `CIVIC:LOCAL` — governance status
   - Top-right: live clock ticking in cyan

3. Point to the **5 metric cards** at the top of the content area:
   - `TOTAL_REQUESTS` — increases every 4 seconds (simulation running)
   - `ACTIVE_ALERTS` — red when threats detected
   - `BLOCKED_IPS` — yellow count
   - `SAFE_TRAFFIC` — green count
   - `SITES_SCANNED` — from extension

4. Point to **RESOURCE_MONITOR** panel (left side):
   - CPU, RAM, NETWORK, STORAGE bars — live percentages
   - Below the bars: SAFE / SUSPECT / ATTACK counters in green/yellow/red

5. Point to **SECURITY_SCORE** panel (right side):
   - Big number (0-100) glowing green/yellow/red
   - Shows `// SYSTEM SECURE` or `// THREATS DETECTED`

6. Say: *"This is all updating live via Server-Sent Events — no polling, instant push."*

   - You'll hear a **rising sweep sound** (Web Audio API)
   - The button changes to `SCANNING...` and goes dim
3. Watch the **AI_ANALYSIS_STREAM** panel (bottom-right of dashboard):
   - Lines appear: `AI> initiating full network scan...`
   - Then: `AI> scan complete — XX packets analyzed`
   - Below that, live threat detections appear like:
     `AI> detected=DDoS ip=45.33.22.11 risk=87`
4. The **SECURITY_SCORE** number updates
5. Say: *"That's Groq's Llama 3.3 70B classifying every packet — DDoS, brute force, port scan, bot traffic."*

   - `RISK` — score in red/yellow/green
   - `STATUS` — `[ATTACK]` / `[SUSPICIOUS]` / `[SAFE]` tags
   - `ATTACK_TYPE` — cyan button (DDoS, Brute Force, etc.)
   - `ACTION` — red `BLOCK` button on high-risk rows
4. Click any **cyan attack type button** (e.g. `DDoS`)
   - A **knowledge panel** pops up bottom-right: `AI_KNOWLEDGE_BASE`
   - Shows AI explanation of that attack type
   - Auto-closes after 12 seconds
5. Click a red **`BLOCK`** button on a high-risk row
   - Hear the **thud sound** (block sound effect)
   - That IP moves to the blocked list instantly

## Key Points to Emphasize

| Feature | What to say |
|---|---|
| SSE live updates | "No polling — pure Server-Sent Events, instant push" |
| Groq LLM | "Llama 3.3 70B classifying every packet in real time" |
| Civic guardrails | "The AI literally cannot block localhost — hard-coded guardrail" |
| Sandbox scanner | "Playwright opens the site in isolation before you load it" |
| Sound effects | "Alert beep, scan sweep, block thud — Web Audio API, no files" |
| Zero database | "Entire system in-memory — zero setup, instant demo" |
| Extension | "Real browser traffic, not simulated — chrome.webRequest API" |

---

## If Something Goes Wrong

- **No traffic showing** → sidebar: click `$ REFRESH DATA`
- **AI scan fails** → check terminal for errors, Groq key is in `.env.local`
- **Civic shows LOCAL** → that's fine, it falls back gracefully, all features still work
- **Extension not showing widget** → make sure you're on an external site (not localhost)
- **Charts empty** → wait 10-15 seconds for simulation to populate data
